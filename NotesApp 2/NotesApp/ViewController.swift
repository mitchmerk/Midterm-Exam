# The Notes List App

	This project is based on the Note-Taking App built in the video Series "Building a Note-Taking App for
iOS 11" by Todd Perkins, located at https://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/Building-Note-Taking-App-iOS-11-Swift/642477-2.html
	You may refer back to that video series if you get confused by the iOS framework calls used in this project.
*However* be advised that this project is not about you learning to build iOS projects but is instead
intended for you apply the Swift concepts we have covered in our classes and labs so far. To that end, this
project differs significantly from the final project of that video series.  The Swift logic you will need
to generate for our version of the app is more complex than that of the video series but in so far
as the use of the iOS framework is concerned, this project is much more simplistic. As a result, this App makes the
following assumptions:

	-The User will not need to save list data or user preference data (to persist between sessions)
	-The User will not have a need to make any long, detailed, or complicated notes
	-The User will only need short simple "single task" notes
	-The User will never need to have a more detailed View of individual notes
	-The User will never need to edit a note after it has been created (though they can be deleted)
	-Notes that are entered with commas indicate there are multiple Notes in the field and the app will split the text and
	add/insert each one into the list depending on the button choice
	-This app will never go into production

The sections from the video series most relevant for our purposes are Chapter 4 (the entire chapter) and
the first video of Chapter 5.   You may also want to view Chapter 3 (about 15 mins long) which breaks down
various aspects of working in a real XCode project (as opposed to the playground files).


You only need to modify the ViewController.swift file (the brains).  However for testing and debugging, you are
being provided the following list of files:

- ViewController.swift
*********DO NOT MODIFY THESE FILES*************
- AppDelegate.swift
- Main.storyboard
- NoteCell.swift


Directions:
1) Either at the very top of this file, or in a separate file within this project directory you must create a Type definition
for a Note type. You must make a potentially important design decision.  Should Note be a Struct or a Class?
Does it matter? If you aren't sure, try both and see which works better if either. You and your partner should discuss the '
final decision and include your reasoning for the decision as a comment infront of the Type definition.  Your reasoning should
be relatively sophisticated aka more than just "Thats what worked".  Why did your choice work better?

It must also have the following properties and methods (with the exact names, spelling, and capitalization as shown):

Type Name - Note

Constant Properties
	- priority: Int
	- message: String

Accessor Methods
	- getPriority : returns an Int representing the priority value for a Note instance
	- getMessage : returns a String representing the message for a Note instance


2) Read the comments and look for the "hooks" that have been left for you to fill in code.  They will be block
formatted comments that describe the logic you need to fill in.  Again, you will only be writing pure Swift to
fix this program and will not need to write any iOS calls.

Hook Example:
	/*************************************
	HOOK:
	The Hooks will look like this.
	A block comment with several lines
	describing what you need to do.

//	If you are familiar with MVC architecture, then this design should look somewhat familiar.
//The viewController orchestrates what is happening in the app "behind the scenes".   It "controls" both the
//Model (in this case our Data Model is the basic array of Notes) and the View and how they communicate.  In
//iOS the View is the file called Main.StoryBoard
//
//The list of items after "ViewController:" is a list of classes that the VC either inherits from or Protocols
//(delegates) that the VC implements.  For now, that is all you need to know about them.
